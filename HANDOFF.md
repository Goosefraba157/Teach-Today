# Teach Today — Handoff File

## Active Direction
- **V1 Teach Today is the active product.** Preserve its current visual design and working teacher/student flows.
- **Slides and presentation mode are the current priority.** Work through the path: Teacher Home -> select group -> build/open lesson -> presentation mode -> slides.
- **The `/v2/` lesson-engine experiment is paused.** Keep it intact for reference, but do not extend it or route users into it while V1 slide work is active.
- **The `lesson-planner-v2-*` files are a presenter prototype, not the paused `/v2/` app.** Harvest useful slide behavior from them into V1 deliberately; do not replace V1 wholesale.
- Do not move or rename V1 runtime files without first auditing GitHub Pages paths, Firebase references, service-worker cache entries, and existing links.

## Recovery Point
- Branch: `codex/v1-slides-recovery`
- Commit: `bf63641` (`Preserve recovered V1 slide presenter work`)
- This commit captures the recovered V1 modifications and the previously uncommitted Lesson Builder V2 presenter files before further work.

## Current Baseline (as of 2026-06-08 Codex session)
- **Student display** — privacy, poster, HFW, passage, and game modes; teacher can open/project from toolbar and presentation dock
- **PDF reference page** — Wilson Readers and Dictation books with dashboard links to current reader/charting and dictation pages
- **Lesson launch** — "Lesson ready" overlay, smoother home-to-teaching-mode handoff
- **Card navigation** — counts for Section 2 word cards and Section 7 HFW
- **Planner preview** — Start Teaching button, sticky scrollable preview, Section 8 real-word sync
- **Syllable Scoop** (redesigned from Syllable Slice) — scoop/cut modes, drawn scoop validation, richer feedback, updated scoring

## Key Files
- `teach-today.js` — main app logic
- `student-display.js` + `student-display.css` — student-facing display
- `Games/` — games including Syllable Scoop
- `service-worker.js` — cache (update when adding new assets)

## Open Questions / Things to Confirm
- The `Teach-Today/` subfolder (~99 files) looks like a packaged copy of the app — intentional?

## In Progress / Next Up
- Audit the existing V1 presentation flow against the recovered presenter prototype.
- Make a slide-by-slide inventory for opening and Sections 1-10.
- Connect the strongest presenter behavior to V1 incrementally, preserving the working V1 route after every change.
- Smoke-test Teacher Home -> lesson -> presentation after each small integration.

## How to Use This File
After a Codex session, paste or write a quick update here:
- What Codex just built or changed
- What's still in progress or next
- Any gotchas or decisions made

Then when starting a new Cowork session, just say "check the handoff" and we'll be synced.
